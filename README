N900 Dynamic DNS README

On the client you must have python and pycurl installed.
Once the dependencies are met, put the script called 80_update_dns in /etc/network/if-up/. This will send a request to the server to update the zone file every time your interface is turned up.

On the server you need a webserver such as Apache that listens on an IPv6 IP address, PHP, BIND, and BASH.
You will need to put update.php in your web server directory, place update_zone.sh in /bin/, and put the provided zone file in the directory with the rest of your BIND zone files. You will also need to configure BIND for the new zone file. 

Also, below is a sugested line to use in sudo so the webserver can execute some of the commands in the php file:

#php thing
www-data ALL= NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/rndc, /bin/update_zone.sh, /bin/sed, /bin/cp
